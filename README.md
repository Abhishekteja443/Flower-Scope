# Flower Scope ðŸŒ¸
Flower Scope is a machine learning project that classifies iris flower species based on their features using various machine learning models. The project uses the Iris dataset and establishes a Flask server to connect the trained models with a web-based frontend.

# Features
- Machine Learning Models: Multiple machine learning models are trained on the Iris dataset.
- Flask Server: A Flask server is used to handle backend processes and connect the model to the frontend.
- Frontend Interface: A simple web interface to interact with the model and get predictions.
